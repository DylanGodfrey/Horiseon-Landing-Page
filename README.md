# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

The motivation of this project was to take an existing website and refactor its code to bring it up to current web development standards including making the site accessable to screen readers. Through this project I learned the value of semantic tags and how to use class and id tags to increase the value of web files without changing the unchanged webpage. 

## Changes from original repo
- Replaced non-semantic HTML tags with semantic ones
- Streamlined the CSS section to make it more readable and easy to upscale
- All images have been given alt text to make them screen reader friendly
- Fixed a broken link to the Search Engine Optimization anchor tag in the nav bar 

## Installation

To install, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/DylanGodfrey/Horiseon-Landing-Page
```

## Usage

Clicking the links in the nav bar will jump the broswer window to the corresponding anchor.
